    <p>I am a final-year engineering student with a strong interest in data analysis, product thinking, and conversational AI. I enjoy breaking down complex problems into simple, user-centric solutions and have hands-on experience working on web applications, dashboards, and chatbot-style interaction flows. Through my academic projects and internships, I have developed a solid foundation in Python, JavaScript, SQL, and data visualization, along with an understanding of how technology can be used to improve user engagement and business outcomes. I am particularly interested in how conversational interfaces can reduce friction, guide user behavior, and drive meaningful interactions at scale. I approach problems with a structured mindset, focusing on clarity, usability, and measurable impact. I am a quick learner, comfortable working with ambiguity, and proactive in seeking feedback to improve my work. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Jio Haptik’s mission of building intelligent, scalable conversational AI solutions and to learn from a team that operates at the intersection of data, product, and user experience.</p>
